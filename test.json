Prolonged exposure to smartphones, video games, and streaming platforms can lead to eye strain, poor sleep quality, reduced physical activity, and shortened attention spans. Socially, individuals risk experiencing isolation when online entertainment replaces meaningful offline connections. Addressing this issue requires a balanced approach: promoting digital well-being, encouraging outdoor recreation, and fostering mindful consumption habits. As technology continues to evolve, society must redefine healthy entertainment practices that maximize benefits without compromising physical or mental health."

With the rapid growth of AI-driven services, e-commerce, and social platforms, users constantly share sensitive information—often without fully understanding the implications. Data breaches, unauthorized tracking, and algorithmic profiling raise concerns about surveillance, exploitation, and loss of autonomy. Governments, tech companies, and advocacy groups must collaborate to establish stricter data protection frameworks, enforce transparency, and empower users to control their information. In a world where data functions as a currency of innovation, protecting privacy is essential for maintaining trust and ethical progress."

The astronauts were subject to regular medical tests throughout the experiment and they were under constant observation via a twenty-four hour closed-circuit television system.
